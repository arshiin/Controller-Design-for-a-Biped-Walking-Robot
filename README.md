# Controller Design for a Biped Walking Robot
 Code for the final project of Linear Control course instructed by Dr. Heidar Ali Talebi in Fall 2020 @ Amirkabir University of Technology.

We designed a PD controller for an inverted pendulum system to simulate the gait cycle of human for a biped walking robot.
